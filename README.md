# php-path-finding

This projects provides a PHP OO implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm for finding the shortest path
between two vertices in a weighted graph.

It aims to provide easy means for customization such as the queue priority algorithm, the vertices lookup, etc.

The unit tests of the various parts are organized in a manner that makes them reusable
in other implementations than the ones provided.

Documentation is scarse, but hopefully not really needed.
Just look around. You should get it fast (I hope as this was the intention).

The library is written in an effort to gain personal experience and knowledge and has not been tested in "real life",
so use on your risk.
